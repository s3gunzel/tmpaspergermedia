                <p>
                    For each new case, an initial consultation is conducted to gather information about the scope of works, and the issues being described. Initial consultations are generally held in-person, and are free of charge for all of our clients, new and existing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initial Consultations provide you with the facilities and ability to meet us, and get to know us a little bit before we start tinkering with your critical business assets.

                    2. Scoping and Contract Signing
                </h3>
                <p>
                    At the conclusion of the initial consultation, Asperger Media will go back and establish a Scope of Works based on your instructions and issues. Asperger Media will only work on things contained within the Scope of Works, so you always have a reference of what we have touched.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we have established a Scope of Works, we will send a contract to you to sign. We usually get our contracts signed electronically, however, can provide a paper copy for your signature on request. Just let us know!

                    Once Asperger Media has a signed contract in place, we can commence work on your issues under the Scope of Works agreed to.

                    Asperger Media may be in touch to verify or provide updates during your contract term. You can always contact us as well if you need anything. We will remain approachable for you throughout your contract term.

                    At the end of each week where we've done work for you under the Scope of Works of your contract, we will issue an invoice for the works conducted and any disbursements we have encumbered for those works.
